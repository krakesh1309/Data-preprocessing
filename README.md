# Data Preprocessing

## Overview
This repository contains scripts and documentation for preprocessing data for machine learning tasks. Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline as it involves cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data to make it suitable for analysis and modeling.

## Contents
- **Scripts**: This directory contains Python scripts for various data preprocessing tasks such as cleaning, feature scaling, encoding, and feature selection.
- **Data**: This directory holds the raw data files that need to be preprocessed.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation on each preprocessing step and how to use the provided scripts is available here.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- 
## Documentation
For detailed documentation on each preprocessing step and how to use the provided scripts, refer to the [Documentation](Documentation/) directory.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the existing scripts or want to add new preprocessing techniques, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
